        <h1>HISTORIC POINTS OF INTEREST IN DOWNTOWN SANTA FE</h1>
        <p>Many buildings of historic interest are within easy walking distance to the Plaza. These buildings, some of which are listed below, display the distinctive architectural style of Santa Fe.</p>

        <h2>The Plaza</h2>
        <p>The Plaza has been the heart of Santa Fe since 1610. It is the site of more major historical, cultural, and social events than anywhere else in the Southwest. In late July, the Plaza is the scene of a Spanish crafts market. In late August, the
            city's busiest attraction, the Indian Market, is held here. During the three-day September Fiesta, the Plaza is filled with food booths and dancing in the streets. On the sidewalk facing the Plaza, Native American vendors from nearby pueblos
            display their jewelry and crafts all year long.</p>

        <h2>Canyon Road</h2>
        <p>Canyon Road has long been a mecca for both artists and art lovers, and is just six blocks southeast of the Plaza. It is a two-mile stretch of art galleries and antique shops. Canyon Road was once a trail to the Pecos Pueblos.</p>

        <h2>Sena Plaza</h2>
        <p>Located on East Palace Avenue, Sena Plaza was the hacienda of Mayor Sena in 1892. It now houses interesting shops, galleries, and a beautiful shaded plaza and garden.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#51a39d;">Mission of San Miguel</h2>
        <p>Located on Old Santa Fe Trail, the Mission was originally built in 1626. It was damaged during the Pueblo revolt in 1680, then rebuilt in 1710. The interior contains good examples of 18th-century religious art, in addition to its fine architectural
            woodwork.
        </p>

        <h2>Palace of the Governors</h2>
        <p>This site is the oldest continuously used public building in the United States. It was constructed in 1610 by Governor Pedro de Peralta, and has been a seat of government under the flags of Spain, Mexico, the Confederacy, and the Territorial United
            States. The Palace was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961, and has been the home of the Museum of New Mexico since 1913. </p>

        <h2>Loretto Chapel</h2>
        <p>The main attraction of this small gothic chapel is the miraculous staircase. Legend claims that the staircase was built by a mysterious carpenter who came in answer to the prayers of the Sisters of Loretto. The spiral staircase was built without
            nails, dowels, or supports of any kind.</p>

        <h2>St. Francis Cathedral</h2>
        <p>Constructed by Archbishop Jean Baptiste Lamy in 1869, this cathedral is a departure from the Spanish heritage of Santa Fe's architecture. The huge, French Romanesque-style building was built around an adobe parish church dating from 1714. The
            older church was incorporated into one corner of the cathedral, and contains the oldest wooden Madonna known to exist in North America.</p>
